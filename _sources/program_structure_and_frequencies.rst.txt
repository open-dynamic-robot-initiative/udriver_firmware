Program Structure & Frequencies

    This was written for the CAN firmware. Does the SPI firmware behave the
    same in this regard?

.. note::

    The information of this page is intended for people who want to modifiy the
    firmware and is not needed if you only want to use it as is.


The programs that run on the microcontroller usually consist of two loops: an
endless loop in the main() function that runs without any timing guarantees and
a main ISR (*Interrupt Service Routine*) function that is triggered by an
interrupt based on the PWM frequency. Everything that is timing critical
(controller, position update, ...) should go to the ISR, while other stuff
should go to the main loop (update of GUI values, etc.). Please note that the
ISR must finish in time (withing 1/f\ :sub:`ISR` seconds) to avoid that
interrupts are missed.

Since not everything in the ISR has to run at full frequency, there are
decimators for these parts of the code. They reduce the frequency by simply
calling the relevant code only at every n-th time the ISR is executed.

The following figure illustrates the two loops and their frequencies.

The frequencies are related on each other with an hierachical system:

-  The base is the PWM frequency f\ :sub:`PWM`
-  ISR frequency f\ :sub:`ISR` is a fraction of f\ :sub:`PWM`
-  Remaining frequencies are fractions of f\ :sub:`CTRL`

**Note:** The current programs (based on the example labs) for dual motor
control are not implemented cleanly. The frequency of the PI controller for
current should be decimated to f\ :sub:`CTRL` but this is not the case in the
current implementation where f\ :sub:`CTRL` is implicitly set to f\
:sub:`ISR` (therefore f\ :sub:`CTRL` is not mentioned in the figure above).
This is only a minor issue, though, as usually f\ :sub:`CTRL` is set to f\
:sub:`ISR` anyway.

"Note" above).

Configure Frequencies
---------------------

The frequencies are set via "decimation factors" in the ``user_jx.h`` files (or
``user_mtr_on_jx.h`` for dual motor projects). See the :doc:`documentation of
the config file repository <user_config:index>` for details.

Program Flow
------------

The following figure shows a simplified illustration of the program flow.
