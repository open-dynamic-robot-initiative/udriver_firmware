Firmware for CAN Communication
******************************

**This section contains information that is specific to the CAN-version of the
firmware.**

This firmware allows torque control of two motors at once using communication
via CAN.  Use this firmware when you want to connect a TI LaunchPad evaluation
board or a BLMC ÂµDriver board via CAN.  If you want to communicate via Ethernet,
using a Master Board, use the :ref:`SPI-version <spi>` instead.

This firmware can be used with the `Universal Dual Motor GUI`_.
